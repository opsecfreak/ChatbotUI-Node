```

3. Set up environment variables
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or

## Setting Up GitHub OAuth

To enable GitHub login, follow these steps:

1. Go to your [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application name**: Your Chat App
   - **Homepage URL**: http://localhost:3000 (for development)
   - **Application description**: (Optional) A description of your app
   - **Authorization callback URL**: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
4. Click "Register application"
5. On the next screen, copy your Client ID
6. Click "Generate a new client secret" and copy the generated secret
7. Add these values to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   GITHUB_ID=your_client_id_here
   GITHUB_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_at_least_32_characters

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_ID=your_github_oauth_app_client_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_oauth_app_client_secret
```

## Authentication Flow

This application supports two authentication methods:

1. **Password Authentication**:
   - A predefined password (`secure_password_123`) is used for admin access
   - In a production environment, you should replace this with a secure user database

2. **GitHub OAuth**:
   - Users can sign in with their GitHub account
   - Basic user information (username, profile image) is retrieved and displayed
   - User data can be stored in a database for persistence

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.

Make sure to configure your environment variables in your deployment platform.
